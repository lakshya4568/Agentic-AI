# Agentic AI Laboratory

This repository contains a collection of labs focused on advanced AI techniques, including text processing strategies and model fine-tuning for multi-modal tasks.

## Repository Structure

The project is organized into the following labs:

### 1. [Lab 1: 5 Levels of Text Splitting](Lab1_Finetuning/)

Located in [Lab1_Finetuning/](Lab1_Finetuning/), this lab covers the core concepts of document chunking. It progresses from simple character-based splits to advanced semantic and agentic splitting techniques.

- **Key Notebook**: [Fine Tuning.ipynb](Lab1_Finetuning/Fine%20Tuning.ipynb)
- **Topics**: LangChain, Chunking Strategies, RAG Preprocessing.

### 2. [Lab 2: Fine-tuning BLIP for Image Captioning](Lab2_Chunking_Method/)

Located in [Lab2_Chunking_Method/](Lab2_Chunking_Method/), this lab provides a hands-on guide to fine-tuning a multi-modal model (BLIP) for generating captions from images.

- **Key Notebook**: [Chunking Method.ipynb](Lab2_Chunking_Method/Chunking%20Method.ipynb)
- **Topics**: Hugging Face Transformers, Image-to-Text, Model Fine-tuning, PyTorch.

## Getting Started

To get started with these labs, it is recommended to have a Python environment set up with the necessary dependencies installed for each lab. Each lab folder contains its own `README.md` with specific installation instructions and summaries.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Jupyter Notebook or VS Code with Jupyter extension
- GPU access is recommended for Lab 2 (Fine-tuning)
